/// Integration tests for the `get_supported_exchanges` Tauri command (AST-021).
///
/// These tests exercise the public API: `exchange::all()` is the domain constant
/// exposed by the infallible `get_supported_exchanges` handler. The command
/// itself has no service or repository involvement — it is a thin pass-through
/// to the domain constant (per locked decision 2 in the plan).
///
/// Tests here verify:
/// - The public `exchange::all()` function is accessible via the crate's public API.
/// - The returned set is non-empty and matches the curated constant.
/// - The returned set contains the 14 MICs committed in the plan.
/// - No duplicate codes are present.
///
/// The command handler itself (the Tauri `#[tauri::command]` fn) is verified at
/// compile time by specta_builder; wiring is confirmed here at the domain level
/// because the handler is a one-liner (`exchange::all()`).
